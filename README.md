# Brixworth
<br>
Interactive Front-End Development Product <br>
Code Inistute Full Stact Developer Course <br>

<br> This is my second project for my Full Stack Developer Course. <br>

The site can be view at: www.silverheath.co.uk/brixworth/index.html

<br>The main concept for site is a resource for visitors and residents of the village of Brixworth. <br> The contents of the site will include a what’s on guide, job and business directory. <br> <br>
I am also hoping to gain extra income, either in the way of advertising on the site,  or by building websites for local companies. <br>

<br>I have decided to hard code the company details into the directory as I wish try and sell that space as advertising. I did toy with using google places but wanted to retain full control on the content and layout.<br>

# UI/UX
<br>Navigation via a navbar base code code from bootstrap.
Initial landing page showing photos taken around the village. In addition a google map showing the village centre and surrounding area. <br> <br>

# Pages to include:
<br>What’s on Guide, Local Jobs, Local Business Directory. <br><br>

Future:
<br>I may add a blog, and a local news page. <br> <br>
