  <p><br>The parish of Brixworth covers an area of 3,148 acres, and rises to a little over 400 ft. above the ordnance datum. The soil is mainly Northamptonshire sandstone, with ironstone and a little clay; the subsoil is ironstone. Iron ore is quarried extensively in the parish and there is a brick and tile works situated on the southern border. <p>

  <p>The chief crops produced are wheat and barley, and much of the land is given to pasture.<p>

  <p>There are several natural springs in the parish. The village is situated on the main road from Northampton to Market Harborough, and about a mile to the west is a station for the Northampton and Market Harborough branch of the L.M.S. railway which passes through the parish. <p>

  <p>Brixworth is the head of a rural district and in 1931 had a population of 1,173. A census in 2011 placed the population as 5228.<p>

  <p>Brixworth Hall stands almost in the centre of the village in extensive grounds, and is a fair-sized building of three stories above a lofty ground floor, probably erected towards the end of the 18th century, but incorporating parts of an older house. <p>

  <p>The plan of the village is unusual, the older houses being grouped round, and largely to the south of, the roughly circular enclosure formed by the Hall and its grounds, and the church lying on the extreme northern edge of the village.<p>

  <p>The above infomation was sourced from British History Online. <br>For more information on the history of the village please visit their excellent <a href="https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/northants/vol4/pp150-157" target="_blank">website<a>.<p>
